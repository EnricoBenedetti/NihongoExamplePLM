System ranking: System 3 > System 2 > System 1

Comment: System 3 provides the highest diversity in sentence structure and usage of the target word "全然," making it the most useful for learners at the N3 level, despite its sentences being slightly more advanced (N2). It captures the abstract and varied contexts similar to the original sentence. System 2 maintains a consistent level of difficulty appropriate for N3 learners but lacks diversity in sentence construction. System 1's sentences, while similar in sense, are more basic (N4) and do not fully challenge an N3 learner, offering less diversity and complexity in usage.

System ranking: System 3 > System 1 > System 2

Comment: System 3 provides the most diverse and complex sentences, which are more suitable for learners aiming for higher proficiency levels (N2-N1), closely matching the target word's usage in varied contexts. System 1 offers sentences that are generally easier (N4) but still relevant, with a medium range of diversity. System 2's sentences are the least diverse and include a rejected sentence due to a mismatch in sense, making it the least useful for learners at the N3 level.

System ranking: System 3 > System 2 > System 1

Comment: System 3 provides the highest diversity in sentence structure and usage of the target word "全然" at a slightly higher difficulty level than requested, which could be beneficial for N3 learners looking to progress. System 2 maintains the target level but with low diversity, making it less engaging. System 1, while similar in sense, offers sentences at a lower difficulty level than requested, which might not be as challenging or beneficial for N3 learners.
