System ranking: System 2 > System 1 > System 3

Comment: System 2 is ranked highest because all its sentences are at the target N5 level, directly addressing the task's requirement for beginners. Although the sentence diversity is low, the consistency in difficulty makes it most suitable for N5 learners. System 1 follows, with a mix of N4 and N5 sentences, offering slightly more complexity but still maintaining relevance and a medium diversity in sentence structure. System 3, while providing high sentence diversity and maintaining a similar sense, includes sentences that are generally above the target N5 level, making it less ideal for absolute beginners.

System ranking: System 3 > System 1 > System 2

Comment: System 3 offers the highest diversity in sentence structure and usage of the target word "時間", making it the most beneficial for learners, especially considering the target level is N5. Although some sentences are above the target level, they provide a good challenge and exposure to slightly more complex structures. System 1 also provides a good mix of sentences close to the target level but with medium diversity. System 2, while accurately targeting the N5 level, offers the least diversity in sentence structure, which might limit learners' exposure to different contexts and uses of the word "時間".
