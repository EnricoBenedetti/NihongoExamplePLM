Comment: System 1 provides a good range of sentences that are mostly relevant to the target word "汚い" and its usage in everyday contexts, suitable for learners around the N3 level, with some sentences leaning towards N4. System 2 also offers relevant sentences but includes one that is simpler (N5), which might not challenge an N3 learner as much. System 3, while offering diverse contexts, includes sentences that diverge significantly in difficulty and relevance to the target context, making it less consistent for learners specifically aiming for N3 proficiency.
