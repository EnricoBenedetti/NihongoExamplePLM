System ranking: System 3 > System 1 > System 2

Comment: System 3 provides the most consistent level of difficulty appropriate for the target N3 level, with sentences that maintain a similar sense to the context sentence. The diversity of sentences is medium, showing different scenarios where the target word is used, which is beneficial for learners. System 1 also offers sentences at a slightly higher difficulty level but with good sense similarity and medium diversity. System 2's sentences are simpler and more suitable for lower proficiency levels (N4-N5), with low diversity in sentence structure and scenarios, making it the least useful for N3 learners.

System ranking: System 3 > System 1 > System 2

Comment: System 3 provides sentences that are most closely aligned with the target difficulty level (N3) and maintains a good sense similarity with the context sentence. The sentences also show a variety of situations where the target word is used, demonstrating medium diversity in syntax and structure. System 1's sentences are slightly more complex (N2) but still relevant and diverse, making it useful for learners aiming for a higher proficiency level. System 2's sentences, while maintaining sense similarity, are simpler (N4) and show low diversity in their structure, making them less challenging and varied for an N3 learner.

System ranking: System "3" > System "1" > System "2"

Comment: System 3 provides sentences that are most closely aligned with the target difficulty level (N3) and maintains a good sense similarity with the context sentence. The sentences also show a variety of scenarios where the target word is used, demonstrating medium diversity in usage. System 1 offers sentences that are slightly more complex (N2 level) but still relevant and diverse. System 2, while providing sentences with the target word, leans towards simpler constructions and scenarios (N4 level), which might not be as challenging or informative for an N3 learner. The diversity in System 2's sentences is also lower, as the sentences tend to follow a more predictable pattern.
