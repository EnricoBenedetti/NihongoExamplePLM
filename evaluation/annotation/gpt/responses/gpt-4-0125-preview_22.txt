This evaluation aims to rate and compare three systems in providing good example sentences for learners of Japanese at different proficiency levels.
An annotation block consists of proposed sentences by 3 systems for a target word, a context sentence and a target difficulty level.
The lists of sentences are supposed to help language learners to see diverse examples of a target word in context.

Difficulty: Rate the difficulty of each sentence according to the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) scale, where N1 is the most difficult and N5 is the easiest.
Indicate which level a sentence belongs to (one of N1, N2, N3, N4, N5). It is possible that for the target level, the system proposes a sentence that is of a different level (higher or lower).
Below is a summary of the proficiency levels.
Level Description Summary Example
N1 Complex and abstract Japanese across various contexts. 「現代社会において、グローバル化の進展が国際的なコミュニケーションの重要性を高めており、異文化間の相互理解が求められている。」
N2 Everyday Japanese in varied situations, with clear materials on different topics. 「地球温暖化対策として、再生可能エネルギーの利用拡大が急務である。」
N3 Japanese in common everyday situations. 「このレストランは美味しいだけでなく、雰囲気も良いので、週末はいつも混んでいます。」
N4 Basic Japanese understanding, including familiar topics, basic vocabulary, and kanji. 「来週の日曜日に友達と映画を見に行く予定です。」
N5 Fundamental Japanese, including hiragana, katakana, and basic kanji. 「私は毎日、日本語を勉強します。」

Sense Similarity: Indicate if the target word in each sentence maintains a close sense as in the original context. Possible values: "similar", "not similar".
Think broadly and intuitively, rather than strictly by dictionary definitions.

Reject: For each sentence, indicate "Reject" if you think the sentence is not good or useful (for example because it does not reflect natural use).

Sentence diversity: For each system output list, rate the sentences diversity, focusing on the amount of different uses of syntax and structure. Possible values: "Low", "Medium", "High".

System ranking: Rank the systems' outputs from best to worst, considering the overall usefulness of the example sentences for that word, for a language learner of that proficiency level.

System ranking: System 1 > System 2 > System 3

Comment: System 1 provides a range of sentences that are slightly above the target level but maintain a good sense similarity and offer diverse contexts of usage, making it useful for learners aiming to progress beyond N5. System 2 also offers sentences with similar sense and slightly varied contexts but leans towards N4 and N3 levels, which might be slightly challenging for N5 learners. System 3's sentences are most aligned with the N5 difficulty level, but the sense similarity is inconsistent, and the rejection of three sentences due to not maintaining the target sense significantly impacts its usefulness. Additionally, System 3's sentence diversity is low, offering less varied learning material.

System ranking: System 3 > System 2 > System 1

Comment: System 3 provides sentences that are most appropriate for the target level (N5), focusing on simple, direct uses of 合う that align closely with the target word's sense in the context sentence. Although the sentence diversity is low, the simplicity and direct relevance to the N5 level make it the most useful for beginners. System 2 and System 1 offer sentences that are more complex and would suit learners at the N3-N4 levels better, with System 1 being slightly more advanced in terms of sentence structure and vocabulary. Both Systems 1 and 2 maintain a good sense similarity but are not as well-suited for N5 learners due to their complexity.

Comment: System 1 provides a range of sentences that are slightly above the target level but offer a good variety of contexts where 合う is used, maintaining a close sense to the original context. System 2's sentences are also useful but lack diversity, focusing more on interpersonal and work-related contexts. System 3's sentences are at the target level but include two instances where the sense of 合う is not similar to the context sentence, focusing more on physical matching like sizes and time, which might not be as useful for understanding the broader applications of 合う.
