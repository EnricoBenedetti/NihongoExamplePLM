System ranking: System 2 > System 1 > System 3

Comment: System 2 provides sentences that are most closely aligned with the target level (N5) and maintains a consistent sense of the target word "持つ" across all examples, making it the most useful for learners at this level despite its low diversity. System 1 offers a good mix of sentences at the N5 and N4 levels, with a medium diversity in sentence structure, making it the second choice. System 3, while offering sentences at the N4 and N5 levels, includes one sentence that does not maintain the target word's sense in the given context, leading to its lower ranking.

System ranking: System "2" > System "1" > System "3"

Comment: System 2 provides sentences that are most closely aligned with the target difficulty level (N5) and maintains a consistent sense of the target word "持つ" as used in the context sentence. Although the sentence diversity is low, for beginners at the N5 level, consistency and clarity are more crucial for understanding basic usage. System 1 offers a good variety of sentences but includes some that might be slightly more complex (N4), making it the second choice. System 3, while offering diverse sentences, includes one that does not maintain the target word's sense appropriately and thus is ranked last.

System ranking: System 2 > System 1 > System 3

Comment: System 2 provides sentences that are most closely aligned with the target level (N5) and maintain a consistent sense of the target word "持つ" as used in the context sentence. Although the sentence diversity is low, the consistency and appropriateness for the target level make it the most useful for learners. System 1 offers a good variety of sentences but slightly ventures into N4 territory, making it slightly less ideal for strict N5 learners. System 3, while offering diverse sentences, includes one that does not maintain the target word's sense as in the original context, leading to its lower ranking.
