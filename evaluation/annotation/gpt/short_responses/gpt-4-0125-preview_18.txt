System ranking: System "3" > System "1" > System "2"

Comment: System 3 provides the most diverse and contextually rich sentences that closely match the target word's use in various situations, making it the most useful for learners at the N3 level, despite being slightly more difficult. System 1 offers sentences that are easier and more directly related to the physical act of holding, which is good for understanding basic usage. System 2, while maintaining the N3 difficulty level, focuses on the metaphorical sense of "holding" (e.g., holding responsibility, goals), which diverges from the original context's physical sense of holding, reducing its usefulness for this specific learning goal.

System ranking: System 3 > System 1 > System 2

Comment: System 3 provides the most diverse and contextually rich sentences that closely match the target word's use in various situations, making it the most useful for learners at the N3 level, despite being slightly more difficult. System 1 offers a good range of sentences with the target word used in a similar sense to the context sentence, with a medium diversity in sentence structure. System 2, while maintaining the target difficulty level, diverges in the sense of the target word, focusing more on abstract uses of "持つ" (to have, to hold in terms of qualities or abstract concepts) rather than the physical act of holding, which reduces its usefulness for this specific learning goal.

System ranking: System "3" > System "1" > System "2"

Comment: System 3 provides the most diverse and contextually rich sentences that closely match the target word's use in the context sentence, albeit at a slightly higher difficulty level (N2) than the target (N3). System 1 offers sentences that are more aligned with the target difficulty level, with a moderate diversity in sentence structure and a similar sense to the context sentence. System 2, while maintaining the target difficulty level, falls short in sense similarity and diversity, with sentences that diverge from the original context's use of the target word and limited structural variation.
