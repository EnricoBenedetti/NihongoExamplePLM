System ranking: System 3 > System 1 > System 2

Comment: System 3 provides the most diverse and complex sentences, closely matching the target difficulty level of N3 and offering a deeper understanding of the target word 合う in various contexts, especially related to focus and alignment, which is more aligned with the original context sentence. System 1 offers a good range of sentences around the N3-N4 level, with a focus on agreement and matching in social contexts, which is useful but less directly related to the technical context of the original sentence. System 2, while providing sentences that are easy to understand, lacks diversity and complexity, making it the least useful for learners aiming for N3 proficiency.

System ranking: System 1 > System 2 > System 3

Comment: System 1 provides a good range of sentences that are closely related to the target word's sense in the context sentence and are appropriate for learners around the N3 level, with a medium diversity in sentence structure and usage. System 2 also offers sentences that are relevant and similar in difficulty but slightly less diverse in context, skewing a bit towards easier levels. System 3, while technically accurate and offering complex sentences, diverges significantly in the sense of the target word, focusing more on physical alignment and optics, which might not be as useful for learners aiming to understand the word in more everyday contexts.

System ranking: System 1 > System 3 > System 2

Comment: System 1 provides a good range of sentences that are close to the target level (N3) and maintains a similar sense to the context sentence, with a medium diversity in sentence structure and usage. System 3, while offering sentences that are technically more complex and closer to the context in terms of subject matter, overshoots the target difficulty level, making it less ideal for N3 learners. System 2 offers sentences that are generally easier and less diverse, making it the least preferable for learners aiming to reach or improve at the N3 level.
